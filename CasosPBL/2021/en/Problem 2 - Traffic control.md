## **Task: Traffic Control**

### **1. Introduction**

One of the problems affecting Brazilian highways is the large number of holes. There are many causes for this problem: one of them is the alternation of rain and sun. Another reason is the pressure that heavy vehicles put on the roads at night, when heavy vehicles circulate more freely on the highways. On the Aratu highway, in Salvador, many holes have been identified by technicians from the Bahia Department of Transportation Infrastructure (DERBA), which has caused several incidents and occasionally serious accidents.

The technicians of this department believe that it is possible to reduce the pressure on the asphalt and, consequently, minimize the hole problem, if they have access to daily information on the number of vehicles that circulate at night on the highway.

Based on this data, the idea is to create a paving wear prevention plan. Technicians classify vehicles into three categories: light, heavy and very heavy. Vehicles up to 6 (six) tons are categorized as light; above 6 (six) and below 10 (ten) tons are categorized as heavy; and 10 (ten) or more tons are categorized as very heavy.

In turn, there are already sensors at the entrance and exit of the Aratu highway that allow vehicles to be identified and categorized. The technicians, then, would like a solution that, based on the information from the sensors already installed on the highway, is able to determine how many vehicles of each category circulated the night before and which category had the most vehicles.

The students of the current class of Computer Theory are studying Turing Machines and understand that they can design a system with these functionalities. That way, they contacted DERBA technicians to offer some solutions to this problem.

### 2. Process

During the process of building the solution, the Problem Based Learning (PBL) teaching and learning methodology will be used. This methodology is characterized by the use of real-world problems to stimulate the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, in addition to contributing to the construction of knowledge about a specific topic.

The process should be documented through the PBL whiteboard, which consists of the QUESTIONS, FACTS, IDEAS/HYPOTHESES, and ACTIONS columns. In each team meeting, a version of the whiteboard should be built, and thus we will have the documentation of the steps for building the solution. In addition, a shared document will be made available for filling in the Logbook, which must contain the minutes of the meetings with the names of the participants, points discussed and challenges encountered. The description of this process will be part of the group's evaluation. In this process, the participation/contribution of each member of the team is essential, so each student will also be individually evaluated based on the observation of the tutors and the feedback of their colleagues.

### **3. Product**

You must post on Moodle UFBA until 6:00 p.m. on January 12, 2020, in the appropriate space: (i) one or more files with Turing machines (JFLAP format) that contain the solution to the problem; and (ii) a report in the SBC article model that describes in as much detail as possible the operation of the traffic control system for this problem.


### **4. Knowledge/Concepts Involved**

- Turing Machines (nmT)
- mT Variations
- Church-Turing Thesis


### **5. Learning Objectives**

#### **5.1 General Objective**
Develop Turing machines to compute solutions to "real" problems, as is the case with the DERBA problem.

#### **5.2 Specific Objectives:**

1\. **Identify** the functionalities of the system idealized by the user

2\. **Reconcile** the functionalities desired by the user with the functionalities of the Turing machine to be developed

3\. **Evaluate** the need to use extensions in the Turing machine to be developed

4\. **Apply**  the Church-Turing thesis to associate the formal concept of a Turing machine with the intuitive notion of an algorithm
