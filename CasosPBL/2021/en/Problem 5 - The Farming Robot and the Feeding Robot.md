## Task: The Farmer Robot and the Feeder Robot

### **1.Introduction**
The Farmer Robot company was highly satisfied with the solutions provided for signaling food delivery and the robot’s return to its starting point. Now, the innovation department is enthusiastic about implementing a new feature and introducing a new robot. As the farmer robot navigates the herds and signals for food delivery, it must also provide the feeder robot with the path it should follow to deliver the appropriate supplies to the herd. This new robot, the feeder, is currently in the prototype phase, and its primary requirement is the development of its navigation module.

Meanwhile, the student team from UFBA, responsible for designing the farmer robot’s initial modules, identified in the literature an abstract machine with sequential read and write access to an unlimited memory device. This machine can incorporate both the farmer robot’s existing modules and the feeder robot’s navigation module. This discovery was shared with the company’s innovation team, which subsequently proposed upgrades to the farmer robot’s modules.

For example, during a review of the signaling solution for food delivery, the students realized that it could be improved by allowing the farmer robot to specify the minimum number of individuals in each herd as inputs for the machine. Additionally, after several meetings with the innovation team to standardize documentation and maintenance team training, it was decided that the same abstract machine model should be used to develop both the upgraded navigation module for the farmer robot and the navigation module for the feeder robot.

The recommended tool for simulating the robot modules is JFLAP [^1].

### **2. Process**
During the solution construction process, the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) methodology will be used. This methodology is characterized by the use of real-world problems to stimulate the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, as well as to contribute to building knowledge on a specific topic.

The process must be documented through the PBL whiteboard, which is composed of the columns QUESTIONS, FACTS, IDEAS/HYPOTHESES, and ACTIONS. In each team meeting, a version of the whiteboard must be created and shared with the tutors, evidencing the evolutionary process of solution construction.

Additionally, a shared document per team, called the Logbook, will be made available. It must contain the minutes of the meetings, including the names of the participants, the points discussed, and the challenges encountered. The description of this process will be part of the group evaluation. In PBL, the participation/contribution of each team member is essential, so each student will also be individually evaluated based on the tutors' observations and their peers' feedback.


### **3. Product**
A team member must upload to UFBA's AVA platform, by 8:20 PM on May 24, 2021, in the designated area, a file for the JFLAP simulator containing the identification module, the navigation module for the farmer robot, and the feeder robot. Additionally, a report formatted according to the SBC (Brazilian Computing Society) standards must be submitted, providing the maximum possible detail about the conceptualization and functioning of the modules developed for the robots.
The report must include the operations performed to ensure the system’s functionality and at least two (2) examples detailing the operation of each developed module.
