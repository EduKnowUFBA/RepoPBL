# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task03 - Farming Robot

## Introduction  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** → Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** → Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.   

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies.

## **Review Findings and Implemented Adjustments**  

### **Knowledge Granularity Refinement**  
Following the reviewers' insights, **the knowledge classification system was updated from CC2012 to CS2013**, which offers a more **fine-grained** and **hierarchical** taxonomy. This change ensures **greater specificity**, making competencies **more reusable** and **better aligned with educational tasks**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
  - **"Finite Automata"** was **redefined** as **"Finite State Machines"**.  


## Revised Competency Specification for Task 03

### Competency Reuse 

    > Testing Automata Using Simulators 

    > Write a technical report

    > Define Regular Expressions for Finite Automata

The competency “Define Regular Expressions for Finite Automata,” originally specified in Task 01, was revised for enhanced clarity and comprehension.

During the review process, it was observed that Tasks 01 and 03 share the competency *"Define Regular Expressions for Finite Automata"*. This competency focuses on the student's ability to translate finite automata into equivalent regular expressions, emphasizing a solid understanding of the relationship between state-based computational models and formal language representations. Students are expected to demonstrate the skill of accurately converting automata into regular expressions that preserve the original machine’s behavior and structure, thereby reinforcing both theoretical knowledge and its practical application in language recognition.
