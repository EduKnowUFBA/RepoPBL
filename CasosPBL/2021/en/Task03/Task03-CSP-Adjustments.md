# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task03 - Farming Robot

## Introduction  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** → Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** → Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.   

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies.
