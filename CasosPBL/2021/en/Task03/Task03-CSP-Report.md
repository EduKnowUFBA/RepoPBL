# Competency Specification Report: Task03 –  The Farmer Robot

## Introduction

This report applies the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** to the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenario entitled **"The Farmer Robot"**, which engages students in developing a prototype system for **herd identification** in extensive livestock farming environments. The scenario is based on a real-world challenge proposed by the company *Farmer Robot*, which seeks a low-cost solution to automate the classification of animals—bovines, caprines, and swine—using a robotic system equipped with a visual identification module.

Students are required to model and simulate the robot’s decision-making process using **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** and **Regular Expressions**, producing a functional prototype in the **JFLAP** environment. The task fosters the integration of formal languages, computational modeling, and analytical reasoning within a collaborative development setting.

Through the CSP methodology, competencies are **derived and structured** from the analysis of the task description, required knowledge domains, specific learning objectives, and behavioral dispositions. The goal is to define a reusable and context-aware competency framework that supports both **technical development** and **educational relevance**.


## 1. Task Description Analysis

The *Farmer Robot* task challenges students to prototype a decision-making module capable of identifying the presence and quantity of specific herds (bovines, caprines, and swine) within farm enclosures. This capability is crucial for automating feed request logistics and optimizing farm management practices.

To meet the company's operational needs and budget constraints, students must design a **finite state machine** capable of:

* **Classifying animals** into distinct herd categories based on visual input;
* **Detecting minimum herd thresholds**, which trigger feed delivery requests;
* **Representing the module behavior** through a JFLAP simulation;
* **Producing regular expressions** that formalize the system logic;
* **Investigating correlations** between herd thresholds and the minimum number of states and transitions required.

In addition to the technical solution, students are required to produce a **technical report** in the SBC article format. This report must explain the system design, provide usage examples, and address company inquiries related to **documentation clarity** and **cost estimation** based on machine complexity.

This task requires learners to:

* **Apply theoretical knowledge** of FSMs and regular expressions to design a computationally expressive and efficient solution;
* **Translate stakeholder requirements** into formal specifications and logical representations;
* **Analyze patterns and structure** within FSMs to optimize design;
* **Simulate and validate** the solution using appropriate tools (JFLAP);
* **Collaborate effectively**, documenting the design process through structured PBL artifacts such as logbooks and whiteboards.

Through this problem-based scenario, students are expected to integrate **computational theory**, **formal modeling**, and **practical reasoning** into a unified, functional prototype aligned with the needs of a real-world stakeholder.



## 2. Knowledge Enumeration

To successfully complete the *Farmer Robot* task, students must draw upon a combination of theoretical and professional knowledge domains. These knowledge areas are aligned with the **ACM Computing Classification System (2012)** for core computing knowledge and the **ACM/IEEE CC2020** framework for foundational professional competencies (FPK).

This interdisciplinary knowledge base supports the development of an effective and optimized decision-making system for animal classification and feed management.

### Computing Knowledge

* **Finite State Machines (Finite Automata)**
  Fundamental for modeling the robot’s classification logic. FSMs allow students to design and simulate the decision process for herd detection using well-defined states and transitions.

* **Regular Expressions (Regular Languages)**
  Used to represent the behavior of the FSM and validate whether the robot’s input patterns match the expected animal classification formats.

* **Requirements Engineering**
  Enables the interpretation and translation of the company’s functional demands (e.g., low cost, minimum thresholds, interpretability) into system specifications and modeling constraints.

* **Modeling and Simulation**
  Supports the creation, execution, and refinement of FSMs within tools such as **JFLAP**, allowing students to test the system’s behavior and validate outcomes against expected scenarios.

### Professional Knowledge (FPK)

* **Analytical and Critical Thinking**
  Essential for decomposing the problem into solvable parts, identifying optimization opportunities (e.g., minimizing states), and interpreting system behavior through logical reasoning.

* **Problem Solving and Troubleshooting**
  Required for resolving design and implementation challenges, such as ambiguous patterns, state explosion, or regular expression inconsistencies.

* **Written Communication**
  Necessary for delivering a clear and well-structured technical report, providing rationale for design choices, and communicating solutions to stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds.

### Competency Reuse 

To address Objective 6, "Test and simulate FSMs using tools such as JFLAP to validate correctness and effectiveness," we reuse the competency previously defined in Task01 – The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks:

  > Testing Automata Using Simulators 


This competency remains fully relevant in the current task, where students are expected to validate their automaton models through formal simulation tools such as JFLAP. The learning outcomes include the ability to execute, observe, and analyze automata behavior in a simulated environment, ensuring functional correctness and alignment with system specifications.

Additionally, since one of the deliverables for this task is a **technical report** formatted according to the academic standards of the **Brazilian Computer Society (SBC)**, we also **reuse the previously defined competency from Task01**:

> Collaborative Technical Report Writing

This competency involves planning, structuring, and composing a comprehensive document that clearly communicates the problem-solving process, decisions made, and justifications for the implemented model. It reinforces essential skills in technical writing, team collaboration, and documentation.

The reuse of these competencies supports the following principles:

* **Pedagogical consistency** in competency development across different learning tasks.
* **Recognition and reinforcement of transversal skills**, such as documentation and tool-based validation.
* **Avoidance of redundancy** through structured competency traceability.
* **Alignment with competency-based education**, where a well-defined learning outcome may be demonstrated in multiple instructional contexts.
