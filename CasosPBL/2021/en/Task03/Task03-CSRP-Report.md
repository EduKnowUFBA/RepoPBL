# Competency Specification Review Report: Task03 –  The Farmer Robot

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the results of the competency specification review for the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task titled *“The Farmer Robot.”* The review was conducted according to the structured methodology of the **Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP)**, with the objective of evaluating the defined competencies in terms of clarity, pedagogical alignment, contextual adequacy, and cognitive appropriateness.

The evaluation drew on expert judgment and was supported by a structured set of criteria. Feedback was gathered through guided interviews with experienced instructors, allowing for a detailed assessment of the competency elements—knowledge, skills, and dispositions—associated with the task. This report synthesizes the findings and offers targeted recommendations to enhance the consistency, instructional relevance, and clarity of the competency specifications.

## 2. Summary of Recommendations

Based on the reviewers' feedback, several key changes are recommended to improve the clarity, alignment, and pedagogical adequacy of the competencies for Task 03. These recommendations address issues such as excessive granularity, inclusion of non-essential theoretical content, ambiguous language, and misaligned Bloom levels.

### 2.1. Knowledge Granularity and Relevance

* **Adjust the level of granularity** of knowledge elements, which are currently too abstract or broad. The focus should shift toward **more specific and directly task-relevant knowledge**.
* **Replace** the knowledge item *“Regular Languages”* with *“Regular Expressions”* in the competency originally titled *“Determine Regular Expressions that represent automata.”*




### 2.2. Competency Refinement

* **Remove** the competency *“Differentiate the classifications of formal grammars,”* as it is not aligned with the task’s actual cognitive or learning requirements.

* **Revise the competency descriptions** to eliminate overly generic or excessively prescriptive language. The competencies should clearly express intended learning outcomes without dictating exact procedures.


* **Rename the competency “Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata”**

  * Replace the verb **“Determine”** with a more expressive and cognitively aligned alternative, such as *Design*, *Construct*, or *Formulate*, to better reflect the intended learning outcome in accordance with Bloom’s Taxonomy.
  * **Review the associated knowledge components** to ensure alignment with the revised competency.
    **Suggested knowledge areas:** Finite State Machines, Regular Expressions, and Analytical and Critical Thinking.


* **Review and adjust the Bloom level** associated with each knowledge component to ensure it matches the expected depth of understanding and type of cognitive processing.

### 2.3. Reformulation of Competency D

* The title and purpose of *Competency D* were found to be unclear and potentially confusing. The following reformulation is recommended:

  > **"Identify patterns in finite state machines"**

* The associated knowledge item should also be revised to match this updated focus, and its level of detail should be adjusted accordingly.

## 3. Conclusion and Next Steps

Implementing the above recommendations will significantly enhance the quality and instructional value of the competency specification for *Task 03 – The Farmer Robot*. By removing irrelevant theoretical content and refining the granularity of the knowledge items, the competencies become more directly aligned with the actual learning goals of the task.

Moreover, reformulated wording and better alignment with Bloom’s Taxonomy will provide clearer guidance for both instructors and learners. These improvements ensure that the competencies are **well-scoped, relevant, and clearly articulated**, which supports effective implementation and assessment.

As a next step, it is advised to incorporate the proposed adjustments into the official version of the competency specification and conduct a follow-up validation with the original or additional reviewers. This iterative process will further ensure the robustness and educational effectiveness of the final competency framework.
