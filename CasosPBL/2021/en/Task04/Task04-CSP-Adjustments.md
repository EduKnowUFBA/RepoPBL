# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task04 –  The Return of the Farmer Robot

## Introduction  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** → Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** → Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.   

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies.

### Competency A Specification

#### A.1 Competency Title

  Develop problem-solving solutions using Pushdown Automata

#### A.2 Textual Description

This competency involves the ability to design and implement computational models using Pushdown Automata (PDAs) to represent behaviors that require memory-based decision-making. Learners are expected to model and simulate systems in which stack-based memory is essential for tasks such as backtracking, nested structure recognition, or sequential navigation.

The application of PDAs may span domains such as robotic control, language parsing, or symbolic computation, and requires understanding how transitions, inputs, and stack operations interact to produce context-aware responses. Students should demonstrate the ability to apply formal concepts to construct models that are both theoretically sound and practically effective for solving problems involving structured or hierarchical processes.

### Competency B Specification

#### B.1 Competency Title

  Interpret rule-based notation

#### B.2 Textual Description

This competency involves the ability to understand and interpret formal rule-based notations, such as context-free grammars, used to define and control system behavior through structured symbol sequences. Learners are expected to analyze how production rules govern valid sequences of operations, enabling the representation of decision-making logic, procedural flows, or communication protocols.

This competency is applicable across domains that require symbolic modeling, such as language processing, robotic control, and formal specification. It emphasizes the comprehension of syntax and rule hierarchies, and the capacity to interpret how such notations define constraints and guide execution within computational systems.

#### B.3 Knowledge Specification

The following knowledge areas are essential for mastering this competency:

* Context-Free Grammars and Regular Languages (Context-Free Languages)
  * Understand how these formal languages define structured symbol sequences and how to construct grammars for recognizing or generating specific behavior patterns.

* Pushdown Automata 
  * Understand the correspondence between rule-based languages and automata capable of recognizing them, particularly the role of memory in parsing nested structures.

* Analytical and Critical Thinking 
  * Apply reasoning skills to interpret rule sets, validate symbolic behavior representations, and refine grammars for clarity, completeness, and correctness.


#### B.5 Knowledge-Skill Pairing

**B.5.1 Mapping Knowledge to Skills**
To demonstrate this competency, students must be able to:

* **Understand** knowledge of Context-Free Grammars and Regular Languages to interpret and construct rule-based representations that define valid symbol sequences governing system behavior.

* **Analytical and Critical Thinking**
    * Apply logical reasoning to compare grammar classes based on structure, expressiveness, and computational requirements. Evaluate which grammar type is most appropriate for modeling specific system behaviors and justify the classification based on formal criteria.

#### C.4 Knowledge–Skill Pairing
