# Competency Specification Review Report: Task04 –  The Return of the Farmer Robot

## **1. Introduction**

This report documents the outcomes of the competency specification review for the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task titled **“The Return of the Farmer Robot.”**

The review was carried out using the structured methodology defined by the **Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP)**. The objective was to assess the proposed competencies with respect to their clarity, cognitive alignment, pedagogical relevance, and contextual appropriateness within the task.

Expert feedback was obtained through guided interviews with experienced instructors, who evaluated the coherence and instructional validity of the competencies, including their knowledge, skill, and disposition components. This document synthesizes those findings and presents evidence-based recommendations to refine the competency definitions, ensuring they are well-scoped, actionable, and aligned with the intended learning outcomes of the task.



## **2. Summary of Recommendations**

Based on reviewer feedback, several adjustments are recommended to improve the quality and relevance of the competencies defined for Task 04. These recommendations focus on improving **knowledge specificity**, **terminological precision**, and **Bloom-level alignment** across all identified competencies.



### **2.1. Knowledge Granularity and Relevance**

* The current knowledge components were found to be **too broad or misaligned** with the specific learning goals of this task.
* The use of **“Finite Automata”** as a knowledge item should be replaced with **“Pushdown Automata (PDAs)”**, which more accurately reflects the complexity and requirements of the modeled behavior.
* Knowledge elements should be explicitly tied to **context-specific modeling demands**, particularly where memory-based state transitions are critical (e.g., return navigation).



### **2.2. Competency Refinement by Task Area**

The table below summarizes specific refinements recommended for each competency associated with Task 04:

#### a. **Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Automata**

* **Replace knowledge**:

  * From: *Finite Automata*
  * To: *Pushdown Automata (PDAs)*
* Justification: PDAs better reflect the stack-based memory needed for modeling return paths in robotic navigation.

#### b. **Interpret Rule-Based Notation**

* **Replace knowledge**:

  * From: *Finite Automata*
  * To: *Pushdown Automata (PDAs)*
* **Update language knowledge**:

  * From: *Regular Languages*
  * To: *Context-Free Grammars* and *Context-Free Languages*
* **Bloom level**:

  * Align with *Understand* — focusing on interpreting and relating symbolic rule structures.

#### c. **Differentiate Classifications of Formal Grammars**

* **Replace knowledge**:

  * From: *Finite Automata*
  * To: *Pushdown Automata (PDAs)*
* **Update language knowledge**:

  * From: *Regular Languages*
  * To: *Context-Free Grammars* and *Context-Free Languages*
* **Bloom level**:

  * Align with *Understand* — supporting learners in recognizing distinctions across grammar types and their corresponding automata.



## **3. Conclusion and Next Steps**

The review of the competency specifications for **Task 04 – The Return of the Farmer Robot** revealed important opportunities for refinement, particularly in the alignment between task-specific cognitive demands and the associated knowledge components. By replacing general automata references with **Pushdown Automata (PDAs)** and updating formal language content to focus on **Context-Free Grammars** and **Context-Free Languages**, the revised specifications better reflect the complexity and educational goals of the task.

The proposed changes also enhance the precision of Bloom’s Taxonomy alignment, ensuring that the expected learning outcomes emphasize appropriate cognitive processes such as *understanding*, *applying*, and *analyzing* rule-based systems and memory-driven control mechanisms.

To ensure that these refinements are successfully implemented, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Update the formal competency documentation** to incorporate the revised knowledge components, skill mappings, and verb annotations aligned with Bloom’s levels.
2. **Revalidate the revised competencies** through a follow-up review with instructors, focusing on instructional clarity, coherence, and applicability to learning assessments.


By executing these steps, the competency framework for Task 04 will become more pedagogically robust, cognitively appropriate, and better suited to guiding students in the modeling and analysis of symbolic control systems using formal methods.
