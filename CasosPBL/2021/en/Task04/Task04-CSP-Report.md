# Competency Specification Report: Task04 - The Return of the Farmer Robot

## Introduction

This report applies the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** to the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenario titled **"The Return of the Farmer Robot"**. The task challenges students to design a navigation module that allows the robot to autonomously return to its initial location after issuing food delivery alerts. The module must be implemented using computational models and validated through simulation.

This scenario is rooted in a real-world agricultural context and emphasizes the application of **formal methods**, including **automata theory** and **context-free grammars**, to address autonomous navigation problems. The proposed solution must be developed in **JFLAP**, with results documented in a formal technical report following SBC (Brazilian Computing Society) standards.

Through the application of CSP, this report identifies and structures the competencies needed to complete the task, focusing on the integration of theoretical knowledge, analytical reasoning, and collaborative problem-solving practices.



## 1. Task Description Analysis

The *Return of the Farmer Robot* task was proposed by the company **Farmer Robot**, following the successful implementation of a previous food delivery signaling module. The new challenge is to enable the robot to autonomously return to its starting point once the alert has been issued.

The student team from UFBA identified that a **finite state machine (FSM)** alone is insufficient to solve the problem. By analyzing the navigation requirements, they concluded that an **auxiliary memory component**—such as a **stack**—was necessary to allow the robot to track its path and reverse its trajectory. This led to the adoption of **Pushdown Automata (PDA)** as the modeling solution.

The solution must simulate the robot’s navigation using **JFLAP**, and document the rules or notations used for path definition and return logic. Additionally, the task encourages teams to consider extending the original Food Delivery Module or designing a parallel solution capable of inter-module communication.

To solve this task, students must:

* Analyze the problem of robotic return navigation and identify the associated computational challenges;
* Use automata theory and memory-augmented machines (e.g., PDA) to model the return behavior;
* Investigate **formal notations** to express location-based rules;
* Implement and test the navigation logic using JFLAP;
* Produce a structured report detailing the solution and reflecting on modeling decisions.

## 4. Competency Specification

### Competency Reuse 

To fulfill **Objective 4 — Use simulation tools for finite automata**, we **reuse the competency "Test Computational Automata Using Simulators"** previously defined in *Task01 – The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks*:

> Testing Automata Using Simulators

This competency remains fully relevant in the current task, where students are expected to validate their automaton models through formal simulation tools such as JFLAP. The learning outcomes include the ability to execute, observe, and analyze automata behavior in a simulated environment, ensuring functional correctness and alignment with system specifications.

Additionally, since one of the deliverables for this task is a **technical report** formatted according to the academic standards of the **Brazilian Computer Society (SBC)**, we also **reuse the previously defined competency from Task01**:

> Collaborative Technical Report Writing

This competency involves planning, structuring, and composing a comprehensive document that clearly communicates the problem-solving process, decisions made, and justifications for the implemented model. It reinforces essential skills in technical writing, team collaboration, and documentation.

The reuse of these competencies supports the following principles:

* **Pedagogical consistency** in competency development across different learning tasks.
* **Recognition and reinforcement of transversal skills**, such as documentation and tool-based validation.
* **Avoidance of redundancy** through structured competency traceability.
* **Alignment with competency-based education**, where a well-defined learning outcome may be demonstrated in multiple instructional contexts.

By **reusing validated competencies**, we ensure that students build upon previously acquired abilities, promote cumulative learning, and facilitate assessment practices based on observable and transferable performance indicators.
