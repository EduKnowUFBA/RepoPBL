## **Task: BMI**

### **1. Introduction**

The Smart Health gym decided to develop a solution that allows its members to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The idea emerged when an instructor noticed that a large number of students asked daily to calculate their current BMI. He realized that a notebook could be made available so students could perform the calculations themselves. As some of these students are enrolled in the Computer Science program at UFBA, he assigned them the task of developing the solution.

**BMI** is an international measure used to assess a person's body fat index and estimate whether they are within a healthy weight range. It is adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for obesity prediction. BMI is calculated as the ratio between a person's weight (in kilograms) and the square of their height (in meters), using the following formula:

```
BMI = WEIGHT / HEIGHT²
```

|     **BMI**     |     **Classification**     |
| :-------------: | :------------------------: |
|       < 16      |       Severe Thinness      |
|  ≥ 16 and < 17  |      Moderate Thinness     |
| ≥ 17 and < 18.5 |        Mild Thinness       |
| ≥ 18.5 and < 25 |           Normal           |
|  ≥ 25 and < 30  |         Overweight         |
|  ≥ 30 and < 35  |       Obesity Class I      |
|  ≥ 35 and < 40  |      Obesity Class II      |
|       ≥ 40      | Obesity Class III (Morbid) |

**Table 1 – BMI Classification Limits.**

The classification adopted by WHO is based on the calculated BMI value, as shown in Table 1.

Write a program, in the programming language of your choice, that reads a person's weight and height, calculates their BMI, and returns the classification according to Table 1. Propose a simple and intuitive interface for user interaction.

Research whether there are more accurate formulas for calculating BMI, apply them, and present a comparison between the different methods found.



### **2. Process**

During the development of this solution, the **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** methodology will be used. This approach is characterized by the use of real-world problems to foster the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, while also supporting the construction of domain-specific knowledge.

The process should be documented using the **PBL whiteboard**, which consists of four columns: **QUESTIONS**, **FACTS**, **IDEAS/HYPOTHESES**, and **ACTIONS**. In each team meeting, a version of the whiteboard must be created, thus documenting the steps taken to develop the solution. This documentation will be part of the group assessment. Additionally, a shared document will be made available to maintain the **Learning Log**, as demonstrated in a synchronous session.



### **3. Product**

One team member must submit, via the UFBA AVA platform, **by 8:20 PM on March 15, 2023**, the following:

* A file containing the solution in the chosen programming language.
* A report written using the **SBC (Brazilian Computing Society)** article format that describes in detail how the BMI calculator works.

The report must include:

* A description of the system’s operations.
* At least **two examples** demonstrating how the system works.
* Responses to the instructor’s questions and concerns regarding BMI calculations.



### **4. Relevant Knowledge Areas**

* Programming Languages
* Requirements Analysis
* Mathematics and Statistics
* Human–Computer Interaction



### **5. Learning Objectives**

#### **5.1 General Objective**

To develop a program that calculates a person's BMI based on user-provided weight and height measurements.

#### **5.2 Specific Objectives**

* Code a solution in a programming language of choice to calculate BMI.
* Create a simple user interface to input data and display results.
* Write a technical report that documents the developed solution.
