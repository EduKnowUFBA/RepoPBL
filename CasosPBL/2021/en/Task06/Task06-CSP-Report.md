# Competency Specification Report: Task 0 – Body Mass Index (BMI)

## 1. Introduction

Based on the structure defined in the Competency Specification Process (CSP), this report presents the application of the CSP methodology to **Task 0 – Body Mass Index (BMI)**, a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenario that integrates Programming Logic, Mathematics and Statistics, and Human–Computer Interaction.


## 2. Task Description Analysis

The BMI task presents a real-world problem where students must design a solution to compute a person's Body Mass Index. The task requires the development of a program using a programming language, simulation of its execution, and the production of a technical report documenting the full development process.

To solve this problem successfully, students must demonstrate the ability to:

* **Apply programming logic** to implement the BMI calculator.
* **Develop a complete software solution** that performs the required calculations.
* **Document the development process** in a structured, technical report.

This task assesses not only students' technical proficiency in **Programming Logic**, but also their capacity to:

1. **Analyze real-world constraints** and translate them into a formal computational model.
2. **Design and implement** a functioning BMI calculator that meets given specifications.
3. **Explain and justify** their design decisions through clear and detailed documentation.

This PBL scenario immerses students in a real-world challenge, bridging the gap between **theoretical knowledge and practical computational modeling**, including simulation and structured documentation.


## 3. Knowledge Enumeration

To systematically identify the required computing knowledge for this task, the **ACM Computing Classification System (2012)** was used as a controlled vocabulary. For **professional knowledge and skills (FPK)**, the **ACM Computing Curricula (CC2020)** served as a reference.

### Computing Knowledge:

* **Programming Languages** – Applying programming structures such as variables, control flow, and debugging to implement a functional BMI calculator.
* **Requirements Analysis** – Understanding and specifying system requirements, ensuring alignment with user needs and correct functionality.
* **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Designing accessible and intuitive user interfaces for input and output of BMI data.

### Professional Knowledge (FPK):

* **Mathematics and Statistics** – Using formulas and quantitative methods to compute and interpret BMI.
* **Analytical and Critical Thinking** – Decomposing problems into logical components and making reasoned decisions.
* **Written Communication** – Producing clear and structured documentation to explain development processes and results.

This knowledge enumeration supports the structured definition of competencies that combine theoretical understanding with practical execution.



## 4. Learning Objectives Identification

### General Objective:

Develop a computational system that calculates a person's BMI, solving a real-world problem through the implementation of a calculator application.

### Specific Learning Objectives:

1. Code a BMI calculator using a programming language of choice.
2. Design a simple user interface for input and output.
3. Write a technical report describing the implemented solution.

These objectives guide students in acquiring:

* **Technical development skills** through hands-on programming.
* **User-centered design principles** via interface construction.
* **Technical communication competencies** through detailed documentation.
