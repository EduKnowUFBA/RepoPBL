## **Task: The farmer robot**

### **1. Introduction**
The company Farmer Robot is developing a robot prototype to identify herds on livestock farms where these animals live freely (extensive livestock farming). This robot was designed with a very advanced visualization module that can classify whether an animal is a cattle, goat, or pig. To improve farm management, such as selecting the food that should be sent to each herd, it is necessary to identify which herds are present in the lots. In order to save money on food transport trips, the robot must send messages requesting food when it identifies a minimum number of individuals from a given herd. These minimum quantities are defined by the farm owner. However, the company Farmer Robot has not yet developed the module responsible for carrying out the aforementioned identification.

One of the technicians from the company, Farmer Robot, who coincidentally is a student in one of UFBA's Computing courses, brought up the problem so that his classmates could, as a team, work to present the prototype of the robot's identification module. For economic reasons, the company Farmer Robot is looking for the least expensive solution possible in this first prototype.

In initial research, students realized that a simple finite state machine is capable of solving this problem. How they came to this conclusion is a good question. Another finding in the research was the discovery of a mathematical expression widely used in protocols, which is easy to understand and can be part of the solution documentation. This expression can be constructed from the moment the solution is implemented with a finite state machine. The students commented on this possibility at a meeting, and the company was interested in learning more about this.

The company is also interested in finding out if there is any rule that allows determining the minimum number of states and transitions based on the minimum quantities of each herd that is desired to be identified. Thus, it will be possible to make more assertive budgets.

The suggested tool to simulate the robot identification module process is JFLAP.


### **2. Process** 

During the solution construction process, the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) teaching and learning methodology will be used, characterized by using real-world problems to stimulate the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, in addition to contributing to the construction of knowledge about a specific topic. The process must be documented through the PBL whiteboard, composed of the QUESTIONS, FACTS, IDEAS/HYPOTHESES, and ACTIONS columns. At each team meeting, a version of the whiteboard must be built, and this way, we will have documentation of the steps to build the solution. The description of this process will be part of the group’s evaluation. In addition, a shared document will be made available for filling out the Logbook, as demonstrated in a synchronous meeting.

### **3. Product** 

A team member must post in AVA UFBA by 8:20 pm on 03/31/2021, in the appropriate space for this purpose, a file for the JFLAP simulator with robot identification module, as well as a report in the article model from the SBC (Brazilian Computing Society) that describes in as much detail as possible the ideal functioning of the robot identification module. The report must contain the operations carried out to make the system work and at least 2 (two) examples of operation. Remembering that this report must also address the company's interests/questions regarding documentation and budgets.
