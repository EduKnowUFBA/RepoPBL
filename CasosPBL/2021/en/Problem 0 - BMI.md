## **Task: BMI**

### **1. Introduction**

Smart Health gym decided to develop a solution for its students to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The idea came up when an instructor reported that every day a large number of students wanted to calculate their current BMI. He realized that a notebook could be made available to students so that they could do the calculations themselves. As some of his students are majoring in computer science at UFBA, he tasked them with solving this demand.

BMI is an international measure used to assess a person's body fat index and estimate whether they are at an ideal weight. It is adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict obesity. BMI is determined by the ratio of an individual's weight (in kilograms) to the square of their height (in meters) and its formula is as follows:

$BMI = weight / height²^2$


|**BMI**|**Classification**|
| :-: | :-: |
|< 16|Underweight (Severe)|
|>= 16 and < 17 |Underweight (Moderate)|
|>= 17 and < 18,5|Underweight (Mild)|
|>= 18,5 and < 25|Healthy Weight|
|>= 25 and < 30|Overweight|
|>= 30 and < 35|Obesity Class I|
|>= 35 and < 40|Obesity Class II|
|>= 40|Obesity Class III (Morbid)|


**Table 1 - BMI Limits.**

The classification adopted by the WHO is made according to the calculated BMI value, as shown in Table 1.

Write a program, in the programming language of your choice, that reads a person's weight and height, calculates their BMI, and returns their classification according to Table 1. Propose a simple and intuitive interface for interaction with users.

Research whether there are other more accurate calculations for BMI and apply them, presenting a comparison between the possible calculations found.


### **2. Process** 
During the process of building the solution, the Problem Based Learning (PBL) teaching and learning methodology will be used. This methodology is characterized by the use of real-world problems to stimulate the development of critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, in addition to contributing to the construction of knowledge about a specific topic. The process should be documented through the PBL whiteboard, which consists of the QUESTIONS, FACTS, IDEAS/HYPOTHESES, and ACTIONS columns. In each team meeting, a version of the whiteboard should be built, and thus we will have the documentation of the steps for building the solution. The description of this process will be part of the group's evaluation. In addition, a shared document will be made available for filling in the Logbook, as demonstrated in a synchronous meeting.

### **3. Product** 
By 8:20 p.m. on March 15, 2023, a team member must post a file of the chosen programming language, a report in the SBC (Brazilian Computer Society) article model that describes in as much detail as possible the operation of the BMI calculator, to the appropriate space on the UFBA AVA. The report must contain the operations executed for the system to function and, at least, 2 (two) examples of how it works. Remembering that this report must also address the interests/questions of the gym instructor regarding the calculations.

### **4. Knowledge Involved** 
- Programming languages
- Requirements analysis
- Mathematics and Statistics
- Human-computer interaction


### **5.  Learning Objective**
#### **5.1 General Objective**
Develop a program that calculates a person's BMI from weight and height measurements provided by the user.

#### **5.2 Specific Objectives** 
- Code, in a free programming language, a solution that calculates BMI.
- Create a simple interface for interaction with the user allowing data entry and presentation of results.
- Write a technical report that presents the solution created.
