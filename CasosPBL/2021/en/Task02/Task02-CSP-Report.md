# Competency Specification Report: Task2 â€“ Traffic Control

## Introduction

This report applies the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** to the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenario entitled **"Traffic Control"**, which engages students in designing a computational solution using **Turing Machines** to address vehicle monitoring and classification on highways. The task integrates formal methods and systems thinking to model a real-world problem posed by the Bahia Department of Transport Infrastructure (DERBA).

Through the CSP methodology, competencies are extracted and structured based on the analysis of the task description, relevant knowledge domains, learning objectives, and behavioral dispositions. The goal is to define a robust competency framework aligned with both **technical skill development** and **collaborative problem solving**.



## 1. Task Analysis

The task challenges students to develop a system that categorizes vehicles (light, heavy, very heavy) based on sensor data, processes traffic information during nighttime, and identifies the most frequent vehicle category. The expected deliverables include Turing Machines (in JFLAP format) and a structured technical report detailing system functionality.

This task requires learners to:
- Model real-world constraints using formal computational tools (Turing Machines);
- Apply theoretical knowledge to a practical classification and analysis problem;
- Translate user-defined goals into precise system specifications;
- Collaborate to design and simulate a viable solution.



## 2. Knowledge Enumeration

The following knowledge domains were identified as essential to task completion, with taxonomy alignment for computing knowledge (ACM CCS 2012) and professional knowledge (CC2020):

### Computing Knowledge
- **Turing Machines**: foundational understanding of computation models, used to simulate the vehicle classification process.
- **Turing Machine Variants**: includes multi-tape and non-deterministic models, potentially used to optimize or extend the traffic processing system.
- **Church-Turing Thesis**: theoretical foundation that supports modeling the problem using Turing Machines.
- **Requirements Engineering**: defines user needs and translates them into formal specifications for system implementation.
- **Modeling and Simulation**: enables the creation and evaluation of representations of system behavior based on real-world data.

### Professional Knowledge (FPK)
- **Analytical and Critical Thinking**: to decompose system requirements and formulate logical solutions.
- **Problem Solving and Troubleshooting**: for resolving technical and conceptual challenges in system modeling.
- **Written Communication**: to produce a structured and coherent technical report.



## 3. Learning Objectives Identification
