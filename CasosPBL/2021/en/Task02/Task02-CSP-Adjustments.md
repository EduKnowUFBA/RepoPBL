# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task02 - Traffic Control

## Introduction  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** → Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** → Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.  

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies.


## **Review Findings and Implemented Adjustments**  

### **Knowledge Granularity Refinement**  
Following the reviewers' insights, **the knowledge classification system was updated from CC2012 to CS2013**, which offers a more **fine-grained** and **hierarchical** taxonomy. This change ensures **greater specificity**, making competencies **more reusable** and **better aligned with educational tasks**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
  

## Revised Competency Specification for Task 02

### Competency A Specification  

### A.1 Competency Title
    Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Turing Machines

### A.2 Textual Description  
Design and implement computational solutions using Turing Machines as a formal model of computation. This competency involves analyzing system requirements, translating them into abstract machine representations, and constructing Turing Machines capable of solving well-defined problems.

Learners must be able to define states, transitions, and input/output behaviors consistent with the problem specification, ensuring logical correctness and completeness. 

This competency emphasizes the application of formal reasoning and computational modeling to address complex problems, preparing students to leverage Turing Machines as a foundational tool in theoretical computer science and algorithmic analysis.

### Competency B Specification

### B.1 Competency Title

    Identify Variants of Turing Machines

### B.2 Competency Description

Demonstrate conceptual understanding of the foundational and extended models of Turing Machines by identifying and comparing different variants—such as multi-tape, non-deterministic, or oracle-based machines—and evaluating their respective computational capabilities, limitations, and use cases.

This competency includes the ability to analyze formal definitions, interpret the implications of the **Church-Turing Thesis**, and determine the adequacy of standard versus extended models for solving complex computational problems. Learners must apply critical and analytical thinking to justify their selections and articulate how different Turing Machine variants impact the expressiveness and efficiency of problem-solving strategies in theoretical computer science.


### Competency C Specification

### **C.1 Competency Title**

    Apply Turing Machine Variants

### **C.2 Competency Description**

Demonstrate the ability to select and apply appropriate **variants of Turing Machines**, such as multi-tape, non-deterministic, or extended models, to design computational solutions tailored to specific problem characteristics.

This competency requires learners to analyze the demands of a computational task and assess whether a standard Turing Machine suffices or if an extended variant offers greater efficiency or expressiveness. It also involves articulating the connection between formal computational models and the intuitive notion of algorithmic solvability, as outlined by the **Church-Turing Thesis**.

Through the use of critical reasoning and modeling skills, students are expected to justify the use of specific Turing Machine variants and effectively implement them to represent or simulate solutions to formal problems in computer science.
