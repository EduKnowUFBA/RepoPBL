# Competency Specification Review Report: Task1 – Traffic Control
## 1. Introduction

This report documents the review of the competency specifications associated with the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task "Traffic Control." The review follows the structured Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP) and aims to assess the accuracy, clarity, relevance, and pedagogical alignment of the defined competencies, including their knowledge, skill, and disposition components.

The review is based on the evaluators’ familiarity with Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy and is structured around the key stages outlined in the CSRP methodology.


## 2. Summary of Recommendations

Based on the reviewer’s feedback, several key changes are recommended to improve the competency specification for Task 02. These recommendations address issues of overly fine detail, unnecessary theoretical content, and inconsistent tone in the current document:

* **Reduce Granularity of Competencies:** Simplify the competency breakdown by merging or removing overly detailed elements. The competencies should be defined at a broader level so that each encompasses a meaningful skill set without listing too many narrow sub-components. This will make the competencies clearer and more manageable, focusing on core abilities rather than excessive detail.

* **Remove Contextualized Knowledge from Competency A:** Revise Competency A to avoid embedding specific knowledge examples directly in its description. In particular, eliminate the reference to *“Turing machines or equivalent universal computational models.”* Such contextualized knowledge pairings are too advanced for this task and distract from the core competency. Instead, Competency A should be stated in general terms of the ability (e.g. designing an algorithmic solution), with any necessary context or examples moved to the knowledge elements or removed if not directly applicable.

* **Eliminate Irrelevant Theoretical Knowledge in Competencies B and C:** Ensure that the knowledge elements listed for Competencies B and C are directly relevant to what the task requires the student to do. In practice, this means removing concepts like the *Church-Turing Thesis* from the knowledge lists, since Task 02 does not actually address or require working knowledge of this theory. All listed knowledge points should reflect topics the task genuinely covers or reinforces, so that the competency specification remains tightly aligned with the task’s content.

* **Reformulate Wording for Clarity and Appropriateness:** Rewrite sections of the competency descriptions to strike a better balance between being too generic and too directive. The language should be specific enough to give clear guidance on the expected outcomes (avoiding vague generalities), yet not so prescriptive that it reads like step-by-step instructions for the task. For example, rather than an overly generic statement like “The student can solve problems,” Competency descriptions should frame the exact capability in context. Conversely, avoid directive wording that tells *how* to do the task (which would more appropriately belong in an assignment prompt than in a competency definition). This improved phrasing will make the competencies both clear and suitably scoped to the level of guidance intended in a specification.

Implementing the above recommendations will result in a more concise and relevant set of competencies for Task 02. The changes focus the competency specification on essential skills and knowledge actually practiced in the task, and they improve the clarity of expectations for learners. These adjustments are detailed in the revised competency specification provided in the Appendix, and they should greatly enhance the alignment between Task 02’s objectives and its evaluation criteria.

## 2. Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, addressing the issues identified by the reviewer will significantly strengthen the Competency Specification for Task 02. By removing extraneous theoretical content and reducing the level of unnecessary detail, the competencies become more closely tailored to the task’s actual learning outcomes. Likewise, the reformulated wording provides clearer guidance without over-constraining how students achieve the task, thereby maintaining flexibility in implementation. Overall, these refinements ensure that Task 02’s competency definitions are **appropriately scoped, relevant, and clearly articulated**, which will help both instructors and students focus on the intended learning goals.

To carry out these improvements, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Revise the Competency Definitions:** Update the Task 02 competency specification document to incorporate all the above recommendations. This entails editing Competencies A, B, and C to remove the identified issues (high granularity, embedded and irrelevant knowledge references) and to apply the improved phrasing. The Appendix of this report provides an updated draft reflecting these changes, which can serve as the basis for the official revision.

2. **Validate with Stakeholders:** Once revised, review the updated competency specification with key stakeholders (e.g. the original reviewer, course coordinators, or subject matter experts) to ensure the changes adequately address the feedback. This validation step will confirm that the competencies are now at the right level of detail and that no essential knowledge has been inadvertently omitted. Stakeholder agreement will build consensus that the revised competencies are sound and acceptable for use.

3. **Implement and Communicate Changes:** Integrate the revised competencies into the course materials and assessment plans for Task 02. It may involve updating any documentation given to students (such as task descriptions or grading rubrics) to reflect the new competency wording. Clearly communicate the changes to all instructors and students involved, so that expectations are transparent. Going forward, monitor Task 02’s delivery to ensure that the task content indeed aligns well with the updated competencies; if any misalignment remains, further minor adjustments can be made in future iterations.

By following these steps, the improvements recommended in this review will be fully realized. The competency specification for Task 02 will be more effective in guiding learning and assessment, having been streamlined and clarified as needed. This concludes the Task 02 Competency Specification review process, with the outcomes documented and ready for implementation.

## Appendix: Revised Competency Specification for Task 02

**Competency A: Designing Algorithmic Solutions** – *Ability to design an effective algorithm or computational solution to solve the given problem scenario (Task 02’s automated traffic control problem) in a structured and logical manner.*
*Knowledge Elements:*

* Understanding of the task requirements and domain constraints (e.g. timing and safety rules in traffic control) and fundamental control logic principles for automated systems.
* Familiarity with algorithm design techniques and planning (such as stepwise refinement or use of pseudocode to outline the solution before implementation).

**Competency B: Implementing and Testing the Solution** – *Ability to implement the designed solution in an appropriate programming environment and verify that it operates correctly according to the specifications.*
*Knowledge Elements:*

* Proficiency with relevant programming constructs and tools needed to develop the solution (e.g. use of loops, conditionals, and any libraries or development environment features required for traffic control logic).
* Knowledge of software testing and debugging methods to ensure the implemented program functions as intended under various scenarios (for example, checking that traffic signals change correctly and on time, and troubleshooting any logical errors).

**Competency C: Evaluating Solution Effectiveness** – *Ability to assess the performance and limitations of the implemented solution and propose improvements if necessary.*
*Knowledge Elements:*

* Understanding of key criteria for evaluating the solution’s success, such as correctness (meeting all task requirements) and efficiency or responsiveness (handling traffic conditions within acceptable timeframes).
* Awareness of any limitations of the current solution and potential improvements or alternative approaches. This includes recognizing conditions where the solution might not perform optimally (for instance, unusually heavy traffic patterns or emergency situations not originally considered) and suggesting reasonable enhancements to address these issues.
