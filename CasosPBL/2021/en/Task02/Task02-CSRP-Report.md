# Competency Specification Review Report: Task02 – Traffic Control


## 1. Introduction

This document presents the results of the competency specification review for the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task titled "Traffic Control." The review was conducted following the structured methodology defined by the Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP), with a focus on evaluating the defined competencies in terms of clarity, accuracy, pedagogical alignment, and contextual relevance.

The review draws on expert judgment and is supported by a structured set of evaluation criteria. Feedback was collected from experienced instructors through guided interviews, enabling a detailed appraisal of the competency elements—knowledge, skills, and dispositions—mapped to the task. This report synthesizes the findings and offers recommendations to improve the coherence, clarity, and instructional value of the competency specifications.



## 2. Summary of Recommendations

Based on the reviewer’s feedback, several key changes are recommended to improve the competency specification for Task 02. These recommendations address issues of overly fine detail, unnecessary theoretical content, and inconsistent tone in the current document:

- **Knowledge Granularity** 
    * The current level is too high and should be adjusted to provide more specificity.  

* **Eliminate Irrelevant Theoretical Knowledge in Competencies B and C:** 
    * Ensure that the knowledge elements listed for Competencies B and C are directly relevant to what the task requires the student to do. 
    
    * In practice, this means removing concepts like the *Church-Turing Thesis* from the knowledge lists, since Task 02 does not actually address or require working knowledge of this theory. All listed knowledge points should reflect topics the task genuinely covers or reinforces, so that the competency specification remains tightly aligned with the task’s content.

* **Reformulate Wording for Clarity and Appropriateness:** 
    * Rewrite sections of the competency descriptions to strike a better balance between being too generic and too directive. The language should be specific enough to give clear guidance on the expected outcomes (avoiding vague generalities), yet not so prescriptive that it reads like step-by-step instructions for the task. 
    
Implementing the above recommendations will result in a more concise and relevant set of competencies for Task 02. The changes focus the competency specification on essential skills and knowledge actually practiced in the task, and they improve the clarity of expectations for learners. 

## 2. Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, addressing the issues identified by the reviewer will significantly strengthen the Competency Specification for Task 02. By removing extraneous theoretical content and reducing the level of unnecessary detail, the competencies become more closely tailored to the task’s actual learning outcomes. Likewise, the reformulated wording provides clearer guidance without over-constraining how students achieve the task, thereby maintaining flexibility in implementation. Overall, these refinements ensure that Task 02’s competency definitions are **appropriately scoped, relevant, and clearly articulated**, which will help both instructors and students focus on the intended learning goals.
