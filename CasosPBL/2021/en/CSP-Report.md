## 1. Introduction

This document is part of a series that applies the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenarios in computing education.

The **CSP** is a structured methodology designed to **identify, classify, and document competencies** embedded in educational tasks. By analyzing the task description, required knowledge, learning objectives, and behavioral dispositions, the process enables the construction of a competency framework that aligns with **real-world problem-solving** and competency-based education principles.

By applying this structured approach, we aim to demonstrate the alignment between **PBL and competency development**, ensuring that learners acquire both **technical expertise** and **essential cognitive and behavioral skills** for practical application.

## 2. Objective

The purpose of this report is to illustrate how the **Competency Specification Process** is applied to PBL tasks by systematically identifying:

- The **knowledge components** necessary to address the task.
- The **learning objectives**—both explicit and implicit—present in the task context.
- The **skills and competencies** required for effective task execution.
- The **behavioral dispositions** that support meaningful learning experiences.

## 3. Report Structure

All reports based on the CSP methodology follow the same structure:

1. **Task Description Analysis**  
   Presents the context and goals of the task, emphasizing the student’s role and required deliverables.

2. **Knowledge Enumeration**  
   Identifies the theoretical and practical knowledge needed, based on standardized taxonomies such as the **ACM Classification System** and **ACM/IEEE CC2020**.

3. **Learning Objectives Identification**  
   Extracts learning objectives directly or indirectly implied by the task, establishing links to educational outcomes.

4. **Competency Definition**  
   Specifies a set of well-structured competencies derived from the task. Each competency is described using a uniform template that includes:

   - **Title and Description**: Defines the scope and expected outcome of the competency.
   - **Knowledge Specification**: Details the relevant conceptual or professional knowledge.
   - **Disposition Specification**: Highlights behavioral attributes such as collaboration, proactivity, and responsibility.
   - **Knowledge-Skill Pairing**: Maps knowledge areas to skills using **Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy**, supported by:
     - Cognitive levels (e.g., *Apply*, *Understand*, *Create*)
     - Verb annotations that clarify expected student actions.
   - **Summary Table**: Synthesizes the competency’s components—dispositions, knowledge, and skills—in a concise tabular format.

This structure ensures **clarity**, **consistency**, and **traceability** between the learning task and the competencies it aims to cultivate.
