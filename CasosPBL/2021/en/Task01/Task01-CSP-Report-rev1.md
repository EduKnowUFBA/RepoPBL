### **Post-CSRP Adjustment Justification (Task01 – The Vending Machine)**

Following the initial application of the **Competency Specification Process (CSP)** and the **Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP)** to Task01, a new refinement cycle was conducted to reassess the granularity and terminological accuracy of the defined competencies. This post-CSRP iteration resulted in a **targeted adjustment** to the core competency title previously labeled as:

> **Develop problem solutions using Automata**

### Rationale for Refinement

While the original formulation adequately captured the task's general requirement to design computational models, the term **"Automata"** was deemed **too broad and underspecified**. It could ambiguously include a variety of computational models—such as **Pushdown Automata**, **Turing Machines**, or even **Linear Bounded Automata**—which **exceed the conceptual scope** of Task01.

In contrast, the reused competence:

> **Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Finite State Machines**

was adopted to reflect the **precise nature of the computational model required** by the task. This adjustment was motivated by the following considerations:

* **Task01 explicitly centers on the design and implementation of solutions using Finite State Machines (FSMs)**—both deterministic (DFA) and non-deterministic (NFA)—alongside regular expressions.
* The task does not involve or require computational models with memory, such as Pushdown Automata, making the term “Automata” overly inclusive and potentially misleading.
* The **granularity of the competence** was revised to align with the **controlled vocabulary** established during the CSP process, which promotes terminological precision for consistency and reusability across learning tasks.
* This change also adheres to recommendations from the CSRP phase to **increase specificity**, ensuring that the competency matches the **learning objectives, expected deliverables, and knowledge components** of the task.

### Outcome of the Adjustment

The updated competence more clearly communicates the technical expectations of the task and enhances alignment with:

* The **knowledge areas** listed in the task: FSMs, Regular Expressions, and Requirements Engineering.
* The **skills expected** at the "Apply" level of Bloom’s Taxonomy.
* The broader educational objective of fostering **structured and implementable computational thinking** based on finite-state representations.

This refinement illustrates the iterative nature of the CSP, where **post-review adjustments** play a critical role in improving the relevance, clarity, and instructional alignment of the competencies defined for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) activities.
