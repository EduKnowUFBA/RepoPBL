# Competency Specification Review Report: Task1 - The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks


## **Transcription and Notes from Guided Interviews with Professors**

# **Introduction to the Transcription and Notes from Guided Interviews with Professors**  

As part of the **Competency Specification Review Process**, a series of **guided interviews** were conducted with expert reviewers **P1 and P2** to evaluate the accuracy, clarity, and alignment of competency specifications within the **Problem-Based Learning (PBL) case "The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks."**  

The primary goal of these interviews was to **identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and areas for improvement** in the definition of competencies, ensuring that they align with **learning objectives, knowledge elements, and skill applications**. The discussions were structured around key aspects of the competency specification process, including:  

- **Knowledge Granularity** → Assessing whether the level of detail in knowledge classifications was appropriate.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Ensuring consistency in terminology and competency descriptions.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Evaluating the effectiveness of action verbs in describing expected learning outcomes.  
- **Textual Clarity in Competency Descriptions** → Identifying ambiguities and improving the precision of competency titles and descriptions.  
- **Knowledge Relevance and Appropriateness** → Determining whether the listed knowledge elements were **relevant, applicable, and correctly mapped** to the task requirements.  

The feedback gathered from these interviews was **instrumental in refining the competency specification process**, leading to **modifications in knowledge categorization, vocabulary standardization, competency restructuring, and textual improvements**. The following transcription presents **key excerpts from the reviewers' feedback**, categorized according to the main themes discussed during the evaluation.  

This structured review ensures that competency descriptions are **accurate, pedagogically sound, and aligned with educational objectives**, ultimately contributing to a **more effective competency-based learning model**.  


### **Knowledge Granularity**  

#### **P1:**  
*"Regarding the knowledge covered in the task, it would be beneficial to adjust it to a lower level of granularity. The current granularity is too high, making comprehension difficult. For example, in the knowledge about finite automata, deterministic automata were not specified, only finite automata were mentioned, which created confusion. Therefore, I suggest modifying the knowledge taxonomy."*  

#### **P2:**  
*"The main issue for me is the granularity of knowledge. The taxonomy used is ACM CCS 2012, but the granularity level is too broad. When comparing the knowledge listed in the tasks, most of them are not explicitly listed in the taxonomy, making it impossible to annotate them properly. For example, in Task 1 ('The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks'), deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, as well as regular expressions, are not included in the taxonomy—it only lists 'regular languages.' Thus, all these annotations need to be revised."*  



### **Controlled Vocabulary**  

#### **P1:**  
*"It is necessary to ensure the standardization of competency descriptions to maintain consistency in the documentation of educational competencies."*  

#### **P2:**  
*"When analyzing the described competencies, I noticed a lack of standardization in the terms used in the annotated resources. To ensure that they can be easily understood and reused, a term mapping system should be implemented."*  



### **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs**  

#### **P1:**  
*"I found the use of multiple verbs interesting, as it allows for a clearer description of the expected actions for each knowledge-skill pair."*  

#### **P2:**  
*"The selected verbs effectively enhance the clarity of skills and are well-aligned with the task and learning objectives."*  



### **Textual Clarity in Competency Descriptions**  

#### **P1:**  
*"Some competency descriptions and knowledge-skill pairs need to be reevaluated to ensure they are more direct and free from ambiguity. For example, in Competency B: 'Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata,' I suggest rewording the title, as it is not sufficiently clear."*  

#### **P2:**  
*"Several competencies need to be reformulated. Some descriptions are overly directive, while others are too generic. Greater clarity is needed so that readers fully understand what the task is asking.*  

*In **Competencies C and D**, the descriptive text about knowledge is unnecessary; I suggest removing the explanation regarding 'The Purpose of Modeling and Simulation' and 'Review of Regular Expressions.'*  

*Regarding **Competency D**, I suggest modifying the competency title from **'Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata'** to **'How to Relate Regular Expressions and Their Equivalent Automata.'** I believe this wording makes the competency clearer.*  

*Additionally, I recommend merging **Competencies D and E**, as they are identical."*  



### **Knowledge Relevance and Appropriateness**  

#### **P1:**  
*"The knowledge described in the task must be better aligned. The specific objectives mention certain knowledge elements that are expected to be applied, but I could not identify where students would actually use them. For example, knowledge about equivalence seems unnecessary, as students may only need to respond regarding deterministic automata.*  

*I recommend **removing the following knowledge elements**, as they are not reflected in the task description:*  
- Identifying the equivalence between **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**.  
- Identifying the equivalence between **Finite Automata (FA) and Regular Expressions (RE)**.  
- Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  

*Similarly, in **Competency B ('Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)'),** the knowledge about DFAs and NFAs is not included in the task description. The other competencies are correctly aligned."*  

#### **P2:**  
*"When defining a competency or skill, it is essential to ensure that the associated knowledge is **relevant and applicable** to the educational context. However, in the knowledge elements listed in the task, there is a mention of **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**, but I could not find any reference to this knowledge in the problem to be solved.*  

Additionally, some of the **learning objectives include knowledge elements that are not addressed in the task description**. Therefore, I suggest removing the following knowledge elements:  
- Identifying the equivalence between **DFA and NFA**.  
- Identifying the equivalence between **FA and RE**.  
- Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  

*Likewise, in **Competency B ('Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)'),** the knowledge suggested is not covered in the **PBL case description**, so it should be removed."*  


# **Summary of Review Suggestions**  

## **P1 Suggestions**  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → The current level is too high and should be adjusted to provide more specificity.  
- **Knowledge and Concepts**  
  - Remove **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)** as it is not covered in the task description.  
  - Remove **learning objectives** that are not explicitly addressed in the task description:  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**.  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Finite Automata (FA) and Regular Expressions (RE)**.  
    - Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  
- **Competency B**  
  - Review and reword the title regarding **when to use DFA or NFA**.  
  - Remove the **knowledge-skill pair "Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)"**, as it is not relevant to the task.  
  - Remove references to **NFA knowledge**, as it is not addressed in the task.  

## **P2 Suggestions**  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → The level is too high and needs refinement.  
- **Textual Refinement** → Some descriptions are **too directive**, while others are **too generic**. Adjustments should improve clarity and precision.  
- **Competency B**  
  - Agrees with P1 on removing the **knowledge-skill pair "Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)"**.  
- **Competency C**  
  - Remove the explanation of the **purpose of modeling and simulation**, including optimization, decision-making, safety considerations, and training.  
- **Competency D**  
  - Remove the **explanation of regular expressions review and their equivalence to finite automata**.  
  - Modify the title of Competency D from **"Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata"** to **"How to Relate Regular Expressions and Their Equivalent Automata"** for better clarity.  
- **Competency E**  
  - Merge **Competency E with Competency D**, as they are essentially the same.  



# **Conclusion: Future Improvements in the Competency Specification Review Process**  

The **competency specification review process** has provided **critical insights into necessary adjustments**, highlighting issues in **knowledge granularity, textual clarity, and alignment with learning objectives**. Based on the reviewers' feedback, **several refinements will be incorporated** to enhance the accuracy, relevance, and clarity of competency specifications.  

A key takeaway is that **the level of knowledge granularity is too high**, making it difficult to accurately annotate competencies. To address this, **a more detailed and structured knowledge taxonomy will be implemented** to improve specificity and applicability. Consequently, **several knowledge elements will be revised or removed**, particularly those related to **NFA concepts**, as they are not explicitly used in the task.  

**Textual clarity will also be improved.** Some descriptions are **overly directive**, while others are **too vague**. To ensure better readability and alignment, **competency titles will be reworded, redundant descriptions will be removed, and unnecessary explanatory content will be eliminated**. Specifically, **Competency D and Competency E will be merged** to avoid redundancy, and **Competency B will be reformulated** to clarify its focus.  

Additionally, **several learning objectives and competency descriptions will be refined** to ensure alignment with the actual task requirements. Concepts that **are not directly addressed in the PBL case will be removed**, preventing inconsistencies between expected learning outcomes and the knowledge elements described.  

Moving forward, the **adoption of a more structured knowledge taxonomy and standardized vocabulary will enhance the clarity, consistency, and applicability** of competency-based learning in PBL environments. The iterative review process **will continue to be applied** to ensure that competency specifications remain aligned with evolving educational needs.  

By incorporating these refinements, the competency framework **will become more precise, structured, and aligned with educational objectives**, ultimately **supporting students, educators, and curriculum designers** in **competency-based computing education**.
