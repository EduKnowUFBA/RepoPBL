# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task1 - The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks

## **Introduction**  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** â†’ Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** â†’ Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** â†’ Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy Verbs** â†’ Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** â†’ Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.  

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies. This process involved **revising knowledge granularity, adjusting terminology, standardizing vocabulary, and refining competency definitions** to enhance alignment with learning objectives and task requirements.  



## **Review Findings and Implemented Adjustments**  

### **Knowledge Granularity Refinement**  
Following the reviewers' insights, **the knowledge classification system was updated from CC2012 to CS2013**, which offers a more **fine-grained** and **hierarchical** taxonomy. This change ensures **greater specificity**, making competencies **more reusable** and **better aligned with educational tasks**.  

### **Competency-Specific Adjustments**  

- **Competency A: "Developing Problem Solutions Using Automata"**  
  - The knowledge element **"Finite Automaton"** was **redefined** as **"Finite State Machines"**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
  - The **"Analytical and Critical Thinking (FPK)"** knowledge component remained **unchanged**.  
  - Skills associated with the above knowledge components **remained unchanged**.  

- **Competency B: "Determining When to Use a DFA or an NFA"**  
  - The competency title was **redefined** as **"Justifying the Use of Finite Automata"**.  
  - The knowledge **"Finite Automaton"** was **redefined** as **"Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)"**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
  - A new **knowledge-skill pair** was added: **"Analytical and Critical Thinking (FPK) - Apply"**, enhancing the clarity and depth of the competency.  

- **Competency C: "Testing Automata Using Simulators"**  
  - The **knowledge element "Finite State Machines"** was **redefined** for improved clarity.  
  - The **knowledge-skill pair "Problem Solving and Troubleshooting (FPK) - Apply"** remained unchanged.  
  - A **new knowledge-skill pair was introduced** â†’ **"Modeling and Simulation - Apply"**, ensuring that learners must apply their modeling knowledge when testing automata using simulators.  

- **Competencies D and E: Merging and Refinement**  
  - P2 recommended merging **Competencies D and E**, as they were redundant.  
  - The competencies **"Determining Regular Expressions that Represent Automata"** and **"Relating Regular Expressions to Finite Automata"** were **merged** into a **single competency**: **"Defining Regular Expressions for Finite Automata."**  
  - Knowledge refinements included:  
    - **"Finite Automaton - Understand"** was **redefined** as **"Finite State Machines - Understand."**  
    - **"Regular Languages - Understand"** was **redefined** as **"Regular Expressions - Apply."**  
    - **"Analytical and Critical Thinking (FPK)"** remained **unchanged**.  

- **Competency F: "Collaborative Technical Report Writing"**  
  - The competency was **redefined** as **"Writing a Technical Report."**  
  - The knowledge **"Technical Report"** was **redefined** as **"Written Communication (FPK)."**  
  - The Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy level remained **"Apply" (Write, Structure, Revise, Refine).**  



### **Controlled Vocabulary Standardization**  
Both P1 and P2 emphasized that the **use of multiple verbs** in competency descriptions is **beneficial**, as it **clarifies expected actions** for each knowledge-skill pair. The standardization of **controlled vocabulary** ensures **greater consistency** and **alignment with predefined learning objectives**.  

To further enhance clarity, a **structured vocabulary mapping** will be established, defining **preferred terms and synonyms** to **maintain coherence across different competency specifications**.  




### **Standardizing Competency Identification for Reusability**  

To enhance clarity, consistency, and reusability, annotators S1 and S2 revised the competency identification codes, implementing a structured renaming strategy. This adjustment ensures that competencies can be effectively reused across multiple tasks and educational contexts, reducing redundancy and improving organization.

The revised competency identification system serves the following key objectives:

Improved Organizational Structure â†’ Establishing a coherent and standardized framework for competency management.
Facilitating Reusability â†’ Enabling competencies to be referenced and applied consistently in various educational tasks.
Alignment with the Competency Annotation Framework â†’ Ensuring that competency definitions follow a structured and scalable approach.
By assigning unique and structured competency identifiers, this approach simplifies competency tracking, retrieval, and integration into different learning environments. The new standardized competency codes, shown in Table 1, provide a clear reference system that supports structured competency development and seamless application in competency-based learning models.
