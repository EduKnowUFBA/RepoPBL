# Competency Specification Review Findings and Adjustments Report: Task1 - The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks

## **Introduction**  

The review process, informed by the expert feedback from **P1 and P2**, identified **key areas for improvement** in the competency specification framework. These insights were categorized into **five major themes**:  
- **Knowledge Granularity** → Ensuring an appropriate level of detail.  
- **Knowledge Appropriateness** → Aligning competencies with relevant and applicable knowledge.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Standardizing terminology to enhance consistency.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Improving clarity in skill descriptions.  
- **Textual Clarity** → Refining descriptions to avoid ambiguities.  

Based on these recommendations, **several refinements were implemented** to improve the specificity, clarity, and reusability of competencies.  



## **Review Findings and Implemented Adjustments**  

### **Knowledge Granularity Refinement**  
Following the reviewers' insights, **the knowledge classification system was updated from CC2012 to CS2013**, which offers a more **fine-grained** and **hierarchical** taxonomy. This change ensures **greater specificity**, making competencies **more reusable** and **better aligned with educational tasks**.  

### **Competency-Specific Adjustments**  

- **Competency A: "Developing Problem Solutions Using Automata"**  
  - The knowledge element **"Finite Automaton"** was **redefined** as **"Finite State Machines"**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
 

- **Competency B: "Determining When to Use a DFA or an NFA"**  
  - The competency title was **redefined** as **"Justifying the Use of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)"**.  
  - The knowledge **"Finite Automaton"** was **redefined** as **"Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)"**.  
  - **"Requirements Analysis"** was **redefined** as **"Requirements Engineering"**.  
  - A new **knowledge-skill pair** was added: **"Analytical and Critical Thinking (FPK) - Apply"**, enhancing the clarity and depth of the competency.  

- **Competency C: "Testing Automata Using Simulators"**  
  - The **knowledge element "Automata over Infinite Objects" was replaced with "Finite State Machines"** to improve clarity. 
  - A **new knowledge-skill pair was introduced** → **"Modeling and Simulation - Apply"**, ensuring that learners must apply their modeling knowledge when testing automata using simulators.  

- **Competencies D and E: Merging and Refinement**  
   - The competencies **"Determining Regular Expressions that Represent Automata"** and **"Relating Regular Expressions to Finite Automata"** were **merged** into a **single competency**: **"Defining Regular Expressions for Finite Automata."**  
  - Knowledge refinements included:  
    - **"Finite Automaton - Understand"** was **redefined** as **"Finite State Machines - Understand."**  
    - **"Regular Languages - Understand"** was **redefined** as **"Regular Expressions - Apply."**  
    - **"Analytical and Critical Thinking (FPK)"** remained **unchanged**.  

- **Competency F: "Collaborative Technical Report Writing"**  
  - The competency was **redefined** as **"Writing a Technical Report."**  
  - The knowledge **"Technical Report"** was **redefined** as **"Written Communication (FPK)."**  
  - The Bloom’s Taxonomy level remained **"Apply" (Write, Structure, Revise, Refine).**  



### **Controlled Vocabulary Standardization**  
Both P1 and P2 emphasized that the **use of multiple verbs** in competency descriptions is **beneficial**, as it **clarifies expected actions** for each knowledge-skill pair. The standardization of **controlled vocabulary** ensures **greater consistency** and **alignment with predefined learning objectives**.  

To further enhance clarity, a **structured vocabulary mapping** will be established, defining **preferred terms and synonyms** to **maintain coherence across different competency specifications**.

## **Conclusion**  

The **competency specification review process** has resulted in **substantial improvements**, incorporating expert recommendations to refine competency definitions, increase specificity, standardize terminology, and improve textual clarity.  

By adopting a more fine-grained knowledge taxonomy (CS2013), competencies have become more precise and reusable. Additionally, the introduction of controlled vocabulary and structured terminology mapping ensures greater consistency in competency descriptions.  

The merging of redundant competencies and adjustments to knowledge elements and skills have led to a more coherent and structured competency framework.   

Moving forward, *ontinuous iterative refinements and structured peer evaluations will remain essential to maintaining a high-quality competency specification model. These refinements will contribute to a more effective competency-based learning approach, ensuring that competencies remain clear, applicable, and aligned with educational objectives. 🚀
