# CSRP-Based Competency Specification Review Report: Task1 – The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the review of the competency specifications associated with the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) task "The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks." The review was conducted using the structured Competency Specification Review Process (CSRP), with the objective of evaluating the clarity, accuracy, pedagogical alignment, and relevance of the defined competencies, including their associated knowledge, skills, and dispositions.

The analysis was informed by interviews conducted with two experienced instructors, using a structured interview protocol. Rather than presenting a full transcription of the interview guide, this report summarizes the structure of the instrument and synthesizes the reviewers’ insights. The review findings are organized according to the main stages of the CSRP, highlighting strengths, inconsistencies, and suggestions for improvement in the competency specification process.


## 2. Summary of Recommendations

### 2.1 Knowledge Granularity

**P1:**  *"Regarding the knowledge covered in the task, it would be beneficial to adjust it to a lower level of granularity. The current granularity is too high, making comprehension difficult. For example, in the knowledge about finite automata, deterministic automata were not specified, only finite automata were mentioned, which created confusion. Therefore, I suggest modifying the knowledge taxonomy."*  

**P2:** *"The main issue for me is the granularity of knowledge. The taxonomy used is ACM CCS 2012, but the granularity level is too broad. When comparing the knowledge listed in the tasks, most of them are not explicitly listed in the taxonomy, making it impossible to annotate them properly. For example, in Task 1 ('The Vending Machine for Sodas and Snacks'), deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, as well as regular expressions, are not included in the taxonomy—it only lists 'regular languages.' Thus, all these annotations need to be revised."*



### 2.2 Controlled Vocabulary

**P1:** *"It is necessary to ensure the standardization of competency descriptions to maintain consistency in the documentation of educational competencies."*  

**P2:** *"When analyzing the described competencies, I noticed a lack of standardization in the terms used in the annotated resources. To ensure that they can be easily understood and reused, a term mapping system should be implemented."*  



### 2.3 Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs

**P1:** *"I found the use of multiple verbs interesting, as it allows for a clearer description of the expected actions for each knowledge-skill pair."*  

**P2:** *"The selected verbs effectively enhance the clarity of skills and are well-aligned with the task and learning objectives."*  



### 2.4 Textual Clarity in Competency Descriptions

**P1:** *"Some competency descriptions and knowledge-skill pairs need to be reevaluated to ensure they are more direct and free from ambiguity. For example, in Competency D: 'Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata,' I suggest rewording the title, as it is not sufficiently clear."*  

**P2:** *"Several competencies need to be reformulated. Some descriptions are overly directive, while others are too generic. Greater clarity is needed so that readers fully understand what the task is asking.*  

- *In **Competencies C and D**, the descriptive text about knowledge is unnecessary; I suggest removing the explanation regarding 'The Purpose of Modeling and Simulation' and 'Review of Regular Expressions.'*  

- *Regarding **Competency D**, I suggest modifying the competency title from **'Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata'** to **'How to Relate Regular Expressions and Their Equivalent Automata.'** I believe this wording makes the competency clearer.*  

- *Additionally, I recommend merging **Competencies D and E**, as they are identical."*  



### 2.5 Knowledge Relevance and Appropriateness

**P1:** *"The knowledge described in the task must be better aligned. The specific objectives mention certain knowledge elements that are expected to be applied, but I could not identify where students would actually use them. For example, knowledge about equivalence seems unnecessary, as students may only need to respond regarding deterministic automata.*  

- *I recommend **removing the following knowledge elements**, as they are not reflected in the task description:*  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**.  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Finite Automata (FA) and Regular Expressions (RE)**.  
    - Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  

- *Similarly, in **Competency B ('Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)'),** the knowledge about DFAs and NFAs is not included in the task description. The other competencies are correctly aligned."*  

**P2:** *"When defining a competency or skill, it is essential to ensure that the associated knowledge is **relevant and applicable** to the educational context. However, in the knowledge elements listed in the task, there is a mention of **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**, but I could not find any reference to this knowledge in the problem to be solved.*  

- Additionally, some of the **learning objectives include knowledge elements that are not addressed in the task description**. Therefore, I suggest removing the following knowledge elements:  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **DFA and NFA**.  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **FA and RE**.  
    - Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  

- *Likewise, in **Competency B ('Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)'),** the knowledge suggested is not covered in the **PBL case description**, so it should be removed."*  


## 2.6 Review Suggestions

### P1 Suggestions
- **Knowledge Granularity** → The current level is too high and should be adjusted to provide more specificity.  
- **Knowledge and Concepts**  
  - Remove **Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)** as it is not covered in the task description.  
  - Remove **learning objectives** that are not explicitly addressed in the task description:  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**.  
    - Identifying the equivalence between **Finite Automata (FA) and Regular Expressions (RE)**.  
    - Applying the equivalence between **FA and RE** to develop **RE based on existing FA**.  
- **Competency B**  
  - Review and reword the title regarding **when to use DFA or NFA**.  
  - Remove the **knowledge-skill pair "Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)"**, as it is not relevant to the task.  
  - Remove references to **NFA knowledge**, as it is not addressed in the task.  

### P2 Suggestions
- **Knowledge Granularity** → The level is too high and needs refinement.  
- **Textual Refinement** → Some descriptions are **too directive**, while others are **too generic**. Adjustments should improve clarity and precision.  
- **Competency B**  
  - Agrees with P1 on removing the **knowledge-skill pair "Equivalence of DFAs and NFAs - Understand (Compare)"**.  
- **Competency C**  
  - Remove the explanation of the **purpose of modeling and simulation**, including optimization, decision-making, safety considerations, and training.  
- **Competency D**  
  - Remove the **explanation of regular expressions review and their equivalence to finite automata**.  
  - Modify the title of Competency D from **"Determine Regular Expressions that Represent Automata"** to **"How to Relate Regular Expressions and Their Equivalent Automata"** for better clarity.  
- **Competency E**  
  - Merge **Competency E with Competency D**, as they are essentially the same.  



## 3. Conclusion and Next Steps

The **competency specification review process** yielded critical insights into areas requiring improvement, particularly regarding **knowledge granularity, textual precision, and the alignment of competencies with the task's learning objectives**. Guided by reviewer feedback, a series of targeted refinements will be implemented to improve the **clarity, relevance, and educational value** of the competency specifications.

A central takeaway from the review is that **the current level of knowledge granularity is excessively broad**, limiting the effectiveness of annotation and reducing conceptual precision. To address this, a **more structured and fine-grained knowledge taxonomy** will be adopted, allowing for greater specificity and better alignment with the actual scope of the task. As part of this adjustment, **concepts related to Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)**—which are not present in the PBL scenario—will be revised or removed.

In addition, **textual clarity will be significantly improved** by refining vague formulations and eliminating overly prescriptive descriptions. Some competency statements were found to be either too generic or too directive. To enhance coherence and usability, **competency titles will be reformulated**, **redundant entries (e.g., Competencies D and E) will be merged**, and **explanatory content not anchored in the task will be removed**. Competency B, in particular, will be restructured to more accurately reflect its intended focus.

Several **learning objectives and competency descriptions** will also be revised to ensure they map directly to the task's demands. Knowledge items that are not **explicitly required** by the PBL case will be removed, thus avoiding misalignment between expected outcomes and the actual competencies developed.

Looking ahead, the integration of a **standardized vocabulary and a structured knowledge taxonomy** will support greater consistency, reusability, and alignment across PBL tasks. The **iterative nature of the CSRP** will continue to be a valuable tool for refining and validating competencies as learning contexts evolve.

By implementing these enhancements, the competency framework will become **more robust, pedagogically sound, and reusable**, offering greater support to students, instructors, and curriculum designers engaged in **competency-based computing education**.

> These revisions will ensure that the competency specification functions not only as a valid assessment instrument but also as a reusable and instructional model for future PBL-based learning experiences.
