# Competency Specification Review Report

## 1. Introduction

As part of the **Competency Specification Review Process**, a series of **guided interviews** were conducted with expert reviewers to evaluate the accuracy, clarity, and alignment of competency specifications within the PBL cases.

The primary goal of these interviews was to **identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and areas for improvement** in the definition of competencies, ensuring that they align with **learning objectives, knowledge elements, and skill applications**. The discussions were structured around key aspects of the competency specification process, including:  

- **Knowledge Granularity** → Assessing whether the level of detail in knowledge classifications was appropriate.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Ensuring consistency in terminology and competency descriptions.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Evaluating the effectiveness of action verbs in describing expected learning outcomes.  
- **Textual Clarity in Competency Descriptions** → Identifying ambiguities and improving the precision of competency titles and descriptions.  
- **Knowledge Relevance and Appropriateness** → Determining whether the listed knowledge elements were **relevant, applicable, and correctly mapped** to the task requirements.  

The feedback gathered from these interviews was **instrumental in refining the competency specification process**, leading to **modifications in knowledge categorization, vocabulary standardization, competency restructuring, and textual improvements**. The following transcription presents **key excerpts from the reviewers' feedback**, categorized according to the main themes discussed during the evaluation.  

This structured review ensures that competency descriptions are **accurate, pedagogically sound, and aligned with educational objectives**, ultimately contributing to a **more effective competency-based learning model**.  



## 2. Task Description Analysis

| **Aspect**               | **Assessment** | **Comments** |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Task Title               | {Clear | Needs Revision} |  |
| Problem Description      | {Clear | Needs Clarification} |  |
| Solution Development     | {Appropriate | Incomplete} |  |
| Expected Outcomes        | {Well Specified | Misaligned} |  |

> _Provide notes on how the task description supports or constrains the competency specification._

## 3. Review of Enumerated Knowledge

| **Criterion**              | **Assessment** | **Comments** |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Comprehensiveness          | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Are all essential knowledge areas included? |
| Relevance                  | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Are all listed knowledge items needed? |
| Appropriateness            | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Should any items be revised or removed? |

> _Consider alignment with a structured taxonomy (e.g., ACM CCS, CC2020)._

## 4. Review of Learning Objectives (LOs)

| **Criterion**              | **Assessment** | **Comments** |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Comprehensiveness          | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Are implicit and explicit objectives represented? |
| Relevance                  | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Are all LOs pertinent to the task? |
| Appropriateness            | {Yes | Maybe | No} | Should any LOs be revised or removed? |

> _Ensure the LOs provide pedagogical direction and map meaningfully to competencies._
