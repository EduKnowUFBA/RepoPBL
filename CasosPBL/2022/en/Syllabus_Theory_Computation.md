# **Introduction to Formal Languages and Theory of Computation**

## **Course Overview**

The course **Introduction to Formal Languages and Theory of Computation** was delivered remotely, using a modern and interactive approach to learning. With the **PBL (Problem-Based Learning)** methodology. The central goal was to stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving through practical situations that bridge theory and real-world applications.

Various tools were employed to create a rich and collaborative learning experience:
- **Google Colab**: Provided materials and hands-on exercises.
- **Meet, Discord, and WhatsApp**: Used for real-time tutorials and Q&A forums.
- **Moodle**: Platform for distributing educational content, submitting assignments, and asynchronous discussions.
- **Email**: An additional communication channel for individual support.

The integration of these tools ensured flexibility and accessibility, fostering an environment conducive to the development of essential competencies in the Theory of Computation.

## **Syllabus**

- Concept of formal language.
- Chomsky hierarchy.
- Regular and context-free languages.
- Regular expressions.
- Finite automata and pushdown automata.
- Context-free grammars.
- Basics of lexical and syntactic analysis in programming languages.
- Turing machines.
- Recursively enumerable and recursive languages.
- Notions of decidability.
- Examples of decidable and undecidable problems related to Chomsky hierarchy languages.
- Turing machine as a formal concept of algorithm.
- The Halting Problem.
- Church’s thesis.
- Basics of Complexity Theory.

## **Course Objectives**

### **General Objective**
To provide students with knowledge of the languages defined in the **Chomsky hierarchy** and their relationships with formal models in the **Theory of Computation**.

### **Specific Objectives**
Develop the following skills and competencies:
- Recognize the concepts of alphabet, word, and language.
- Manipulate languages, recognizers, and grammars.
- Develop finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines.
- Relate automata to the analysis modules of a programming language compiler.
- Understand the limits of Computation.
- Recognize the application of Church’s Thesis.
- Understand the classes of problems **P**, **NP**, and **NP-Complete**.

### **Additional Competencies with the PBL Methodology**
With the adoption of **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**, the course also aims to:
- Conceptualize problem situations using the tools of the Theory of Computation.
- Propose formal computational representations and solutions for real-world problems.
- Evaluate the application of formalisms with different expressive powers to represent and solve presented problems.
