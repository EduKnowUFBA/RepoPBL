### Post-CSP Competency Refinement and Hierarchical Structuring

After completing the CSP-CSRP cycles for **Task01**, and finalizing the competency specifications for Tasks 201, 202, 203, and 204, a follow-up CSP review was conducted. This iterative refinement revealed a structured and hierarchical relationship among core competencies related to computational modeling.

The general competence:

> **C05 – Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Automata**

was redefined as a **meta-competency** that aggregates three specific competencies, each corresponding to a distinct computational model from the Chomsky Hierarchy. These include:

* **C12 – Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Finite State Machines (FSM)**
* **C14 – Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Pushdown Automata (PDA)**
* **C09 – Develop Problem-Solving Solutions Using Turing Machines (TM)**

This structure reflects a **conceptual and didactic hierarchy** based on increasing computational power and abstraction. As such, the mastery of **C05** is only considered evidenced when all three component competencies (**C12**, **C14**, and **C09**) have been demonstrated in concrete learning tasks.

### Rationale

This decision was motivated by the following:

* Each sub-competency (FSM, PDA, TM) was explicitly targeted and evidenced in tasks that involve distinct theoretical models and problem domains.
* The generic label "Automata" in C05, while pedagogically valid, lacks the specificity needed for fine-grained evaluation and tracking of learning outcomes.
* Aligning competencies with the **Chomsky Hierarchy** provides a modular and progressive structure for curriculum design, allowing educators to scaffold computational theory more effectively.

### Assessment Policy

* Competence **C05** is **not to be directly evidenced** in a single learning task.
* Instead, it is validated **indirectly** via the combined evidence of its three component competencies.
* This model improves **traceability, modularization**, and **semantic clarity** in competency-based learning.
