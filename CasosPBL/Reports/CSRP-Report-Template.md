# Competency Specification Review Report

## 1. Introduction

As part of the **Competency Specification Review Process**, a series of **guided interviews** were conducted with expert reviewers to evaluate the accuracy, clarity, and alignment of competency specifications within the PBL cases.

The primary goal of these interviews was to **identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and areas for improvement** in the definition of competencies, ensuring that they align with **learning objectives, knowledge elements, and skill applications**. The discussions were structured around key aspects of the competency specification process, including:  

- **Knowledge Granularity** → Assessing whether the level of detail in knowledge classifications was appropriate.  
- **Controlled Vocabulary** → Ensuring consistency in terminology and competency descriptions.  
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy Verbs** → Evaluating the effectiveness of action verbs in describing expected learning outcomes.  
- **Textual Clarity in Competency Descriptions** → Identifying ambiguities and improving the precision of competency titles and descriptions.  
- **Knowledge Relevance and Appropriateness** → Determining whether the listed knowledge elements were **relevant, applicable, and correctly mapped** to the task requirements.  

The feedback gathered from these interviews was **instrumental in refining the competency specification process**, leading to **modifications in knowledge categorization, vocabulary standardization, competency restructuring, and textual improvements**. The following transcription presents **key excerpts from the reviewers' feedback**, categorized according to the main themes discussed during the evaluation.  

This structured review ensures that competency descriptions are **accurate, pedagogically sound, and aligned with educational objectives**, ultimately contributing to a **more effective competency-based learning model**.  

## 2. Summary of Recommendations

Summarize the major changes to be made based on the review, such as:
- Additions/removals in knowledge components
- Revised learning objectives
- Merged or renamed competencies
- Adjusted Bloom-level alignments



## 3. Conclusion and Next Steps

Reflect on:
- The impact of the review on the clarity, pedagogical strength, and alignment of the competency set.
- How the findings will inform future iterations of the CSP or similar tasks.
- Recommended actions for finalizing the task-competency package.
